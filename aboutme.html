    <p>Hello everyone. I currently am doing the business management major. And I am finishing
        up my junior year after this semester. The thing I love most about BYU-I is that I have
        been able to continue my degree online.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are playing basketball, going skiing, and dirtbiking. I am married and
        my wife is expecting on July 1st. It is going to be a girl and we are super excited. </p>
        <p>
          My current job is digital and social marketing manager for the Smith Group. I think that 
          this class will be able to help me understand more how I can better our companies sites.   
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been a memeber of the church ever since I was 8 and I am currently 23. I was able to 
            serve a mission in the San Jose California mission and got to learn Vietnamese.
        </p>
