        <h3>Activities</h3>
        <p>
          We all know that being bored is never fun. With that being said here on this page you will be able to see some ideas that we find to be very fun.
          If you never have been to Idaho Falls before it is important to know that we have all four seasons here. This is important because the majority of 
          people here love to spend time outdoors. In the winter people love to hit the mountains to ski, snowboard, or snowmobile. In the summer a lot of people
          love to go camping, ride dirtbikes, or go hiking. If you enjoy any of those things look down below for a list of different spots that people love to go to 
          for these activities. If you do not like any of these activities don't worry because Idaho Falls still has some really great activities to offer that are indoors. 
          With each of these activities we will provide the price and how much time it typically takes to do the activity. We would love to get your feedback so feel free 
          to leave a comment below the activity that you choose to do. Also if you have any recommendations on places you would like us to add then please send us an email
          at stratonfacer1@gmail.com.
