      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to be able to a one stop shop when people want to know where they should go or what they should do in Idaho Falls. I want the website to be easy to use and I want people to be able to find exactly what they are looking for if that be food, activities, or service. It can be easy to just sit at home and not know what to do because you have not been told about something amazing. With my website people will be able to try new things and be able to try things they would have otherwise not tried. Do you feel like you want to try something new or exciting?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who comes to Idaho Falls and wants to know what they should do.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        [Written copy for the Page 2 here]
        There is nothing worse then being so hungry and you sit down to eat somewhere and the food is gross.
        When you are hungry you need to know that where you go is going to satisfy your hunger. 
        On this page you will find places that do just that. 
        We have made sure to have a wide variety of choices so that you can decide is you want to try something new or a more safe bet. 
        Each of these places are places that we have gone to and personally enjoy going to.
        We grade each of these places on the quality of their food, how their service is, the price, and the overall experience. 
        Now we know that everyone has different preferences but we will also give our personal recommendation of what we get at each of these places. 
        As you go and try one of these places feel free to leave a comment down below and tell us what you thought of it. If you would like you can 
        also tell us what you got and if you would get it again. 
      </p>

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        [Written copy for the Page 3 here]
        We all know that being bored is never fun. With that being said here on this page you will be able to see some ideas that we find to be very fun.
        If you never have been to Idaho Falls before it is important to know that we have all four seasons here. This is important because the majority of 
        people here love to spend time outdoors. In the winter people love to hit the mountains to ski, snowboard, or snowmobile. In the summer a lot of people
        love to go camping, ride dirtbikes, or go hiking. If you enjoy any of those things look down below for a list of different spots that people love to go to 
        for these activities. If you do not like any of these activities don't worry because Idaho Falls still has some really great activities to offer that are indoors. 
        With each of these activities we will provide the price and how much time it typically takes to do the activity. We would love to get your feedback so feel free 
        to leave a comment below the activity that you choose to do. Also if you have any recommendations on places you would like us to add then please send us an email
        at stratonfacer1@gmail.com.
